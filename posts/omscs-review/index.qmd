# I'm done!

![](./diploma.png){fig-align='center'}

I applied to Georgia Tech Online Masters of Computer Science programme in Jun 2020 and started the programme in that Fall. A little over 3 years later, I am finally a proud graduate! I could not have completed this journey without the support of my wife, my family family as well as my work family. In keeping with the tradition of many alumni before me and to do my part in paying it forward, here are some of my reflections about this programme.
Hey there, fellow techies and lifelong learners! After an exhilarating 3+ year journey, I can finally call myself a proud graduate of the Georgia Tech Online Masters of Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Let me tell you, it's been quite the adventure, and I couldn't have made it without the unwavering support of my amazing wife, family, and fantastic work crew. As I bask in the post-graduation glow, I want to share some thoughts and insights about this remarkable program – a little something to pay it forward, just like the awesome OMSCS alumni before me.

# OMSCS

As a quick primer, in the increasingly competitive landscape of fully online-based Masters programmes for Computer Science, Georgia Tech's OMSCS is not only one of the pioneer programmes in this space, but also rather undisputedly the top option for many students that come from all walks of life. When I applied for this programme, I was primarily looking for rigour and structure. Like many data scientists in my generation, I came into this career from an adjacent field (Operations Research was mine). There weren't any Data Science master programmes during my time as that job simply did not exist before HBR's famous article. And like many who came from adjacent fields into this wild west, there was a lot of self-learning required. So very early into my career, I had plenty of experience learning on my own time from materials ranging from papers, textbooks to blog posts and stackoverflow posts. And while I was confident that I could continue to scrappily learn a lot of things on my own, I also began to wonder if I could learn more with something more structured like a proper masters programme curriculum. Of course, like many other busy professionals, I needed a programme that could accomodate my time, finances and learning goals. And just as thousands of others, I could not find a programme better than OMSCS that checked all those boxes.

As I bask in the post-graduation glow, I want to share some thoughts and insights about this remarkable program – a little something to pay it forward, just like the awesome OMSCS alumni before me.
Now, for those not in the know, let me give you a quick rundown on OMSCS. In the increasingly competitive landscape of fully online Computer Science Master's programs, Georgia Tech's offering stands as one of the true pioneers and, undisputedly, one of the top choices for students from all walks of life. When I first applied back in June 2020, I was primarily drawn to the program's rigorous yet structured curriculum.
You see, like many data scientists of my generation, I had transitioned into this field from an adjacent domain (Operations Research was my thing). Back in those days, Data Science as a job didn't even exist – at least not in the way we know it now, thanks to that famous HBR article. We were the wild west pioneers, constantly self-learning from a hodgepodge of papers, textbooks, blog posts, and good ol' StackOverflow threads. While I was confident in my ability to keep scrappily learning on my own, I couldn't shake the feeling that a structured, proper Master's program could take my knowledge to new heights.
Of course, being a busy professional, I needed a program that could accommodate my time, finances, and learning goals. And you guessed it – OMSCS ticked all those boxes and then some, just like it has for thousands of others in my position.

# The Exercism CLI


## Setup

1. Create an account on Exercism, navigate to your settings page and copy your authentication token to the clipboard.
2. Install the Exercism CLI with `brew install exercism`
3. Specify which workspace directory you want the CLI to download problems to with `exercism configure -w <directory>`

## Solving and Submitting Exercises

Now that we've covered the overall approach, you're ready to start tackling some exercises. On Exercism, programming languages are organized into what they call [Tracks](https://exercism.org/tracks). Each track contains a series of coding exercises arranged from easiest to hardest. You'll find a great selection of tracks for both popular languages and some more obscure ones. No matter how familiar I think I am with a language, I always end up learning something new from the exercises. And it's been really cool to get exposed to languages I'd never even heard of before. The variety ensures there's something engaging for everyone to explore.

1. Find an exercise from a Track
2. Copy the exercism cli command to download the problem. E.g. `exercism download --track=python --exercise=chaitanas-colossal-coaster`
3. Navigate to your configured workspace directory and start solving! Use the provided unit tests to see if your implementation is correct. `pytest -v`
4. Once all tests are passed, submit your solution with `exercism submit`

## Learning and getting feedback

Your learning doesn't stop after you submit an exercise solution. You can navigate back to the problem page and check out how other Exercism users approached the same exercise. I've lost count of how many times I've picked up a clever new technique or a more idiomatic way of writing code just by exploring the top-rated solutions from others.

But in my opinion, the **killer feature** of Exercism is the ability to request a code review from an actual human mentor - not a bot. Code reviews are a huge part of real software development jobs, so it's fantastic that this platform exposes you to that process in a supportive, low-stress environment. Getting that experience early on is invaluable!

Hope you found this short write up useful and you give Exercism a try!
