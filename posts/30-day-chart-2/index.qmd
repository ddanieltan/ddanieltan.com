# Neo
Today's theme is Neo, and since I couldn't immediately think of an associated chart, I decided to go with my first instinct: create something related to the groundbreaking 1999 movie, [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix). I remember watching The Matrix as a kid and being amazed by its mind-bending plot, cool 90s fashion, and fluid action scenes.


```{python}
import numpy as np
import polars as pl
from PIL import Image

from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()
```


# geom_spoke()
Another interpretation of "Neo" is the concept of "new." While browsing the Lets-Plot gallery, I came across a unique geom - [geom_spoke()](https://nbviewer.org/github/JetBrains/lets-plot-docs/blob/master/source/examples/cookbook/geom_spoke.ipynb). This is quite a rare geom that I rarely see used outside of weather maps showing wind fields. It occurred to me that this geom also resembles bullets, which inspired me to create the following...


```{python}

image = Image.open('./neo.jpeg').resize((1000,600))
img = np.asarray(image)

np.random.seed(43546)

bullets = pl.DataFrame({
    "x": np.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=1000, size=(100,)),
    "y": np.random.uniform(low=0.5, high=600, size=(100,)),
    "col": np.random.uniform(low=-3.0, high=3.0, size=(100,)),
    "radius": np.random.uniform(low=-100, high=100, size=(100,)),
    "angle": np.random.uniform(low=-3.14, high=3.14, size=(100,))
})

p = (
    ggplot(bullets, aes('x','y'))
    + geom_imshow(img, alpha=0.8)
    + geom_point(size=3, shape=19, color='#db3069')
    + geom_spoke(aes(angle='angle',radius='radius', color='col'), pivot='tip')
    + theme_minimal()
    + scale_color_continuous(low='#db3069', high='#f5d547', guide='none')
    + labs(
        title = "Neo: What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?",subtitle= "Morpheus: No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready\n you won't have to. ðŸ˜Ž",
        caption = "#30DayChartChallenge Day 2 | Neo\n Made by: www.ddanieltan.com"
    )
    + theme(
        plot_caption=element_text(size=12, color='grey'),
        plot_margin=[20,90,10,0],
    )
    + ggsize(900,600)
)

p

```


```{python}
#| output: False
ggsave(p, 'day2.png')
```

# TIL
- Made my very 1st plot with `geom_spoke()` today, who knows when I'll get a chance to use this unique geom again
