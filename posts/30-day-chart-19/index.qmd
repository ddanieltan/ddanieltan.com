Today, our team is dinosaurs, which made me think about the [Datasaurus Dozen](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs/)! This wild set of datasets is an extension of the famous [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Despite having completely different-looking distributions when plotted, every single one of the Datasaurus Dozen datasets has the exact same summary statistics.

The Datasaurus Dozen is a great reminder for all us data folks to always look beyond summary statistics like the mean and standard deviation to truly understand what's going on with your data.
```{python}
#| code-fold: true

import polars as pl
import plotly.express as px

df = pl.read_csv('./datasaurus.csv')

fig = px.scatter(df, 
    x='x', y='y', color='x',
    animation_frame='dataset', 
    range_x=[df['x'].min(), df['x'].max()], 
    range_y=[df['y'].min(), df['y'].max()],
    template='simple_white',
    width=500, height=500,
)

fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1]["frame"]["duration"] = 1000
fig.update_coloraxes(showscale=False)
fig.update_layout(
    title= 'The Datasaurus Dozen<br><sup>Each of these datasets share the same summary statistics</sup>',
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title=None,
    margin = dict(l=0, r=0, b=45),
    showlegend=False,

1. In general, I find Plotly's configurations quite unintuitive and a lot of the answers that I look for end up in a forum/StackOverflow post somewhere online:

- [Configuration to slow down animation was found nested in this community post] (https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-slow-down-animation-in-plotly-express/31309/5)

- [Configuration to remove the colorbar was found in this Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58630928/how-to-hide-the-colorbar-and-legend-in-plotly-express-bar-graph)
