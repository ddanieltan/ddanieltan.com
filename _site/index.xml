<section id="learning-theme" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-theme">Learning Theme</h2>
<p>It’s the start of the new year, which means I’m committing to a new learning theme for the year! I’ve found that having a single learning theme for the whole year helps keep me focused and prevents me from getting too excited about exploring new topics. It also helps me make both short- and long-term plans without stressing myself out too much, since I’m juggling my independent learning with time for my family, work, and school. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2022scala/">post about my learning theme for 2022</a>, my goal is to find the right balance.</p>
<p>This year, I’m focusing on <strong>Causal Inference</strong>! 🎊 🥳 🎊 🥳 🎊 🥳</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-causal-inference" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-causal-inference">What is Causal Inference?</h2>
<p>If you’ve taken a statistics class or worked in the data industry, you’ve probably heard this warning: “Correlation does not imply causation!” While this is definitely true, I’ve always wondered, “Well, what does imply causation?”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>When we use correlation and other measurements of association in our machine learning models, we end up with a good understanding of dependence. ML models are great at identifying patterns that link our features to outcomes, which is why they can make such accurate predictions. But even with these accurate predictions, we may not always have a clear understanding of the complex cause-and-effect forces at play in the system.</p>
<p>That’s where causal inference comes in. It’s the study of these cause-and-effect forces – not just being able to predict future outcomes, but also understanding which factors contribute and how.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causal-inference-can-answer-questions-classic-experimentation-theory-cannot">Causal Inference can answer questions classic Experimentation theory cannot</h3>
<p>At work, I’m often involved in designing online experiments using randomized control trials (also known as A/B tests), which are considered the gold standard for gathering causal inferences. But RCTs aren’t always feasible – sometimes the question we’re trying to answer requires a longer timeline, or it might be unethical to test (like the effects of smoking).</p>
<p>Outside of the clean data we get from RCTs, there’s a wealth of observational data from field experiments, surveys, and logs that we can use to draw causal inferences. There are so many interesting questions that we can generate looking at these data and causal inference could provide me new tools to my statistical toolkit to answer them.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causal-inference-is-relatable-to-everyone">Causal Inference is relatable to everyone</h3>
<p>Second, causal inference is something that’s relevant to everyone. We all make a ton of decisions every day – from what to have for breakfast to whether we need to take an umbrella with us. A lot of these decisions are influenced by our understanding of the causal forces at play in our lives. I believe that, with the right set of skills, we can “play the hand we’re dealt” as best we can, even if we can’t change the circumstances we were born into.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="there-is-a-resurgence-of-materials-to-help-one-learn-causal-inference">There is a resurgence of materials to help one learn Causal Inference</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s been a resurgence of materials on causal inference lately, starting with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02799-7#:~:text=13%20October%202021-,Nobel%2Dwinning%20'natural%20experiments'%20approach%20made%20economics%20more%20robust,and%20effect%20in%20social%20science">Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to proponents of the field in 2021</a>. There are more resources available now than ever before to help people learn about causal inference, which makes it a great time to dive in.</p>

<section id="plan-for-the-year" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plan-for-the-year">Plan for the Year</h2>
<p>Here is my collection of study materials that I plan on using this year:</p>
<section id="structured-courses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structured-courses">Structured Courses</h3>
<p>Structured or semi-structured courses with assignments and projects are my favourite format for learning. I found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/projects/essential-causal-inference-for-data-science">Coursera’s Essential Causal Inference Techniques for Data Science</a> . This looks to be a straight-forward, short introduction to causal inference techniques to survey the landscape.</p>
</section>
<section id="materials-that-come-with-a-community" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-that-come-with-a-community">Materials that come with a community</h3>
<p>These are the primary resources I plan to use, particularly because these are all resources that facilitate a community of learners either by providing a study group or video lectures. This is important to me because I enjoy have this community to learn with and learn from.</p>
<p><a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com/">Scott Cunningham’s Causal Inference Mixtape</a> is the single most recommended material on Causal Inference. You can read the free online copy or support the Prof.&nbsp;Cunningham by purchasing a print copy (links on the home page). Last year, <a href="https://community.intuitivebayes.com/c/book-club/21">Ravin Kumar organised a Causal Inference Book Club</a>, so there is a lively community of online discussions and youtube videos to study along side with.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking</a> is perhaps my favourite textbook of all time. While this material is more often billed as an introduction to Bayesian statistics, I have always found a lot of the central themes align with the pursuit of causality. The printed copy needs to be purchased but Prof.&nbsp;McElreath provides free recordings of his lectures on youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&amp;list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus&amp;ab_channel=RichardMcElreath">2023’s lectures</a> just began this month.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>What do you mean it’s not a thing to have a “favourite textbook”?! Everyone has one, right? Right?</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html">Matheus Facure’s Causal Inference for the Brave and True</a> is another material that is on the top of many recommendations. The above 2 recommendations primarily have their code examples in R, so Matheus’s alternative with Python examples fits a nice gap. Matheus is also working on an O’Reilly book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/">Causal Inference in Python</a> which I am eagerly waiting for.</p>
<p><a href="https://theeffectbook.net/">Nick Huntington-Klien’s The Effect Book</a> rounds up my list of recommended materials. The Effect Book is a comprehensive dive into causal inference paired with research design, and Dr.&nbsp;Huntington-Klien even includes an accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTBLulJV_AK1hKtnO0-kYrU0D09K-kj8">free Youtube video series</a> along with homework assignments and source code to learn from. The online version of the book is free and you can purchase the print copy from links on its home page.</p>
</section>
<section id="materials-for-solo-studying-and-referencing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-for-solo-studying-and-referencing">Materials for solo studying and referencing</h3>
<p>This is a shorter list of materials that do not come with a ready online community. These are more traditional academic textbooks that I plan to peruse occasionally when referencing a gnarly topic.</p>
<ul>

<section id="learning-by-doing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-by-doing">Learning by doing</h2>
<p>This is a rough draft of the type of projects I can do during this year to complement my learning.</p>
<section id="causal-inference-projects" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causal-inference-projects">Causal Inference Projects</h3>
<p>I plan to work my way up from simple notebooks and exercises illustrating the usage of one of the many causal inference libraries. Eventually, being able to complete a larger analysis more akin to the type of problems I hope to address at work. I would like the opportunity to try out several different libraries from a variety of programming languages, if applicable. I bookmarked <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/causal-design-patterns/">Emily Riederer’s blog on Causal Design Patterns for Data Analysts</a> for reference, and I hope to be able to implement each of the patterns she describes by the end of the year.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-about-the-causal-inference-landscape" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-about-the-causal-inference-landscape">Learning about the Causal Inference landscape</h3>
<p>Causal Inference is a broad umbrella comprising of many professionals from a wide swathe of disciplines. Besides learning the technical methodologies, I would like to learn more about the academics, educators and practitioners that make up its global community. Prof.&nbsp;Cunningham also records a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mixtape-with-scott/id1615110472">podcast interviewing several causal inference experts</a>. It might be a nice break from studying to allocate some time to listen to their stories and write a few summary posts on my blog.</p>
</section>
<section id="blogging" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blogging">Blogging</h3>
<p>Which brings me to this blog! Last year, I started this blog and published 8 blog articles. I aim to publish 12 this year (mostly about Causal Inference) and share with you the learnings along my journey.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ok, so that’s the plan! Thank you to everyone who reached out to give me suggestions on what to focus on this year. I’m brimming with excitement, onward!</p>

  <title>2022 Year of Scala Recap</title>

<section id="my-year-of-scala" class="level1">
<h1>My Year of Scala</h1>
<p>In 2022, I chose the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala programming language</a> as my learning theme. This meant that I would use Scala in projects big and small, with a focus on understanding how I could incorporate Scala into my toolset. I shared my motivations in greater detail in an earlier blogpost <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2022scala/">2022: My Year in Scala</a>.</p>
<p>As we end 2022, here’s my recap and reflections on how I got to understand this programming language better and what I would recommend if you are interested to do the same.</p>
</section>
<section id="projects-i-completed-with-scala" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Projects I completed with Scala</h1>
<p>Learning by doing has always been the most effective way to learn new things. One of the advantages to focusing on a single learning goal for an entire year is that I could pepper in both small and large Scala projects. This helped me to protect against my enthusiasm to use Scala for everything, and hopefully I avoided the classic “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail” trap. Here are some of my favourite projects that I completed with Scala:</p>
<section id="built-a-scala-application-for-work" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="built-a-scala-application-for-work">1. Built a scala application for Work</h4>
<p>My impetus to learn Scala was primarily because I had to use it at work, so I am very proud of the fact that I got sufficiently up to speed with Scala within the year to actually build a Scala application that that adds value to myself and my team 😊!</p>
<p>I won’t dive into specifics on this public platform to respect sensitive work projects. But just to get a sense, this application interacts with an enterprise-grade Spark cluster and handles an enterprise-grade volume of data. Most importantly, this application fills in a gap in our existing tooling and delivers real value for its users. The choice to use Scala for this application was perfect because there was plenty of interaction with Spark and that it fits in well with our existing codebase.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Did I mention “enterprise-grade” enough? 😆</p>
</div></div></section>
<section id="built-a-random-number-generator-for-school" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="built-a-random-number-generator-for-school">2. Built a Random Number Generator for School</h4>
<p>I took a course on <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/isye-6644-simulation-and-modeling-engineering-and-science">Simulation and Modeling</a> as part of my part-time masters programme this year. Our final project had a variety of questions and I chose to attempt one that required an implementation of one of the many Random Number Generators learnt in class.</p>
<p>I used Scala to build a <a href="https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/kapadia/project2/node9.html">Tausworthe Generator</a> that required multiple data transformations and bitwise operations. I reflected that Scala’s Type system and ease of data transformation patterns made for such a great fit for this project.</p>
</section>
<section id="attempted-this-years-advent-of-code-in-scala" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attempted-this-years-advent-of-code-in-scala">3. Attempted this year’s Advent of Code in Scala</h4>
<p>Every year, I get excited for the global coding challenge known as the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. In preparation, I worked my way through the Scala solutions for 2021’s AoC and consolidated a few Scala tips in this <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/aocscala/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Using Scala for 2022’s challenge was also incredibly fun! The challenge really nailed home that Scala is a high level language well-suited for the general problem solving. In particular, I really enjoyed Scala’s flexibility as it relates to using mutable/immutable data structures. While the immutability is encouraged as a default, no one bats an eyelid if you choose to use mutability on occasion, because frankly some problems in AoC are much easier to grok that way.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-i-liked-about-scala" class="level1">
<h1>What I liked about Scala</h1>
<p>After a year of trying to learn not just the syntax of the language but also appreciate its design, my favourite thing about Scala is how <strong>ergonomic</strong> it makes writing code feel.</p>
<p>Scala reminds me of several specially crafted ergonomic tools that I have come across, such as the <a href="https://eames.com/en/articles/eameschair">Eames chair</a> or the <a href="https://dvorak-keyboard.com/">Dvorak keyboard</a>. On first impression, most people find these tools strange and question why anyone would use something so different from the norm. I certainly felt that same way approaching Scala, coming from a primarily Python background. I could not understand why there was such an emphasis on the Type system, the functional patterns seemed foreign to me and I was curious why there was a small niche community that seemed so fervent in their support for this strange language.</p>
<p>I am glad I had an entire year to incorporate Scala into my daily tasks, because I eventually grew to enjoy Scala. Scala has an expressiveness that seeps into how I approach problems, and how I think about solutions. I still find reading scala code idiosyncratic at times but I also get occasional Aha moments where I appreciate the elegance of how a solution is communicated. Similar to the aforementioned designer chair and keyboard layout, once you commit to using these tools, you start to appreciate its intentional design and ergonomic benefits.</p>
<p>While its community and usage is (and probably will always be) niche, I have also found them to be welcoming and patient with new users like me! You can connect with the community primarily on the Scala Discord server or on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/">/r/scala</a>.</p>
<p>I consider myself way too green to give a proper commentary on Scala’s core design so instead let me echo this point from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26030970">Li Haoyi’s Hacker News thread about Scala</a>. Comparing programming languages is complicated, but from a distance, it truly does feel like many other languages are converging to the features Scala provides today. And, I think this says a lot about how thoughtful and well implemented the Scala language is.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-i-disliked-about-scala" class="level1">
<h1>What I disliked about Scala</h1>
<p>To keep things balanced, I also want to touch upon things I struggled with this year.</p>
<section id="tooling" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tooling">1. Tooling</h4>
<p>I did not enjoy the “enterprise-grade” Scala build tool <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a>. That <code>sbt</code> once represented “Simple Build Tool” must surely be someone’s cruel joke. I remember vividly being particularly annoyed that to run a simple Hello World example, many sites wanted you to first grok <code>sbt</code>. I felt that the context switch to understand build tools in general and <code>sbt</code> in particular took my attention away from trying to learn the basics of Scala.</p>
<p>I bounced around to other build tools, such as <a href="https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/mill/mill/Intro_to_Mill.html">Mill</a> but felt that outside of a handful of projects, I could not find sufficient examples particularly of simpler projects using Mill to help me better understand the tool.</p>
<p>My saving grace came later in the year when <a href="https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/">scala-cli</a> picked up development steam. <code>scala-cli</code> is not a full fledged build tool capable of replacing <code>sbt</code>, but it was exactly the tool a beginner like me was looking for. A simple tool that allows the user to run Scala applications and occasionally handle simple packaging.</p>
<p>I’m so glad to hear scala-cli might go on to be the default way we execute scala code in the future. I think it would alleviate one of the biggest hurdles beginners have to overcome when first learning Scala.</p>
</section>
<section id="documentation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="documentation">2. Documentation</h4>
<p>I’m probably spoilt by the huge amount of documentation available online for Python and its landscape of libraries. Additionally, it is not just the quantity of documentation and answers for all things Python, it is also the SEO.</p>
<p>I found it so perplexing that simply Googling a Scala library name and method often does not yield the correct documentation page I am looking for as a top result. Even after I located right ScalaDoc page, I found navigating the page difficult and discoverability for new methods poor. I sorely missed having example lines of code showing a method’s usage which is something I have gotten used to from reading documentation sites for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">pandas</a> or <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">numpy</a>.</p>

<section id="what-i-would-recommend" class="level1">
<h1>What I Would Recommend</h1>
<p>If you are embarking on your own Scala learning journey, here are my recommendations.</p>
<section id="basics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basics">Basics</h4>
<p>The best resource I found for learning the basics of the Scala syntax is <a href="https://www.scala-exercises.org/">Scala Exercises</a>, particularly the module introducing the standard library. In there, you will find a dedicated set of explanations and interactive examples for all the key Scala language features.</p>
<p>Another great resource for learning the basics would be the official <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html">Tour of Scala</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practice">Practice</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, I am a big proponent of learning through practice. So my recommendation is that once you get a good understanding of the basics, you try your hand at completing some classic programming puzzles or tasks. I am very fond of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> but feel free to try your hand at other well known resources like <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>.</p>
<p>I would recommend to aim to use Scala’s standard data structures to solve these puzzles. These buiding blocks are incredibly robust and powerful and are key to unlocking a lot of the ergonomy I alluded to earlier.</p>
</section>
<section id="textbooks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="textbooks">Textbooks</h4>
<p>I surveyed a variety of textbooks in the year, and for the most part, all of them were good. If you’re pressed to choose, I found myself coming back again and again to <a href="https://www.handsonscala.com/">Hands-On Scala</a>. This textbook was my favourite because it had a nice variety of projects that you could incrementally build along whilst learning more about Scala and its ecosystem.</p>
</section>
<section id="tooling-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tooling-1">Tooling</h4>
<p>For beginners, I advocate for what I consider to be the most frictionless path to get started writing Scala code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install everything you need to write and run Scala via <a href="https://get-coursier.io/">Coursier</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/">scala-cli</a> for compiling, running and packaging Scala scripts and applications</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Vscode</a> with the <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">Metals extension</a> as your development environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many alternatives to these technologies but you can take your time to explore them after you get started.</p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I had a blast in 2022 working my way through Scala! It has been one of the most interesting and rewarding learning topics I have attempted.</p>

<p>As we move onward to 2023, I have no plans of dropping Scala from my toolset. Scala will remain one of my favourite languages to solve problems with. Honestly, it has pretty much become my daily driver.</p>
<p>That said, I am absolutely itching to find a new topic to sink my teeth into for 2023. Let me know if you have any suggestions for me. Happy learning everyone! 🤔🤔🤔</p>

<section id="normconf" class="level1">
<h1>2022 NormConf</h1>
<p><a href="https://normconf.com/">NormConf</a> is a free, virtual tech conference created by <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/">Vicki Boykis</a> with a keen focus on all the unglamourous challenges that real-life data science practitioners encounter in their day-to-day work. In an arena where many other tech conferences focus on the latest and greatest, this conference is a breath of fresh air! I can sincerely share that I found more ideas to bring back to try at my work from this conference than any previous conference I have attended.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2022-normconf/https:/normconf.com/images/normconf_banner.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The conference was held in a single day, split between 3 sessions and several lightning talks. Each session had about 10 speakers covering a variety of topics. All of these are available for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@normconf">NormConf’s youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend catching up on all the talks and wanted to share a couple of my favourites:</p>
</section>
<section id="session-1" class="level1">
<h1>Session 1</h1>
<section id="spark-horror-stories-from-the-field-by-guenia-izquierdo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spark-horror-stories-from-the-field-by-guenia-izquierdo"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxUb8gRcASg">Spark Horror Stories From The Field</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guenia/">Guenia Izquierdo</a></h2>
<p>This talk right here is totally my jam. <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> is an amazing tool. In fact, to conduct and model experiments for a large-scale business operation (like I do for work), the usage of Spark is pretty much <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/table_stakes#:~:text=Noun,let%20alone%20ensure%20a%20win">table stakes</a>. That said, like many powerful tools, Spark is also a frustrating <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=footgun">footgun</a>.</p>
<p>Guenia shares her experience on common pitfalls you might encounter when building Spark applications for the 1st time. I found myself nodding silently as she went through every mistake that I personally faced when I first started learning Spark. Additionally, she gives useful tips explaining the implications for each Spark command you invoke which promotes a better understanding of the entire Spark framework.</p>
<p>If you are new to Spark, I have to recommend the first couple of minutes of Guenia’s talk as she provides one of the clearest and most succint crash course to Spark I have seen presented.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-game-of-construction-by-helena-sarin" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-game-of-construction-by-helena-sarin"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ">A Game of Construction</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/NeuralBricolage">Helena Sarin</a></h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Art is all a game of construction. Some with the brush, some with the shovel, some choose the pen and some of us … choose <strong>neural networks</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote up thre is how Helena started her talk 🤯 and boy was I absolutely blown away. Describing herself as an “engineering-artist”, Helena shared details and examples of her artwork and art process. I was deeply inspired by the many similarities Helena drew between the process of refining art work with the iterative nature of building complex models.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed the rare occasion where I get to <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/boogiewoogie/">play with generative art</a>, and listening to a true artist’s artist share about her process was an incredible treat.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="session-2" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Session 2</h1>
<section id="ml-doesnt-always-replace-rules-sometimes-they-work-together-by-jeremy-jordan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ml-doesnt-always-replace-rules-sometimes-they-work-together-by-jeremy-jordan"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXe9iXNTuDc">ML doesn’t always replace rules, sometimes they work together</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyjordan">Jeremy Jordan</a></h2>
<p>Jeremy’s talk touches upon a very real set of skills required to run machine learning solutions in a highly regulated environment such as a bank or financial institution. I really enjoyed the nuance Jeremy’s talk provides to how we can combine rules based heuristics and machine learning into a robust policy layer.</p>
<p>As with any complex solution, the talk is less of a how-to but more of a framework of discussions you should be looking to have if your team is building a solution that matches this use case.</p>
</section>
<section id="ethan-rosenthal-and-the-m1-misadventure-by-ethan-rosenthal" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethan-rosenthal-and-the-m1-misadventure-by-ethan-rosenthal"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4wkCSd7iMM">Ethan Rosenthal and the M1 Misadventure</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/eprosenthal">Ethan Rosenthal</a></h2>
<p>Ethan’s M1 Misadventure covers all the trials and tribulations he went through to get his team’s codebase built on the new M1 Macs, and what can I say… A story about chasing obscure errors, finicky dependencies and the endless loop of upgrading/downgrading/backtracking changes just to get something work? That’s both my guilty pleasure 🍿🍿, as well as, an average work day 🥲.</p>
<p>Ethan makes sure to share some useful tips about Python environments and dependency management too if you’re looking for tips in that category. I enjoyed this talk mostly because it validates that getting that darn code to compile/run is a common problem for any data scientist.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>They don’t call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a> for nothing 😈😈😈</p>
</div></div></section>
</section>
<section id="session-3" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Session 3</h1>
<section id="how-many-folds-is-too-many-efficient-simulation-for-everyday-ml-decisions-by-julia-silge" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-folds-is-too-many-efficient-simulation-for-everyday-ml-decisions-by-julia-silge"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM">How many folds is too many? Efficient simulation for everyday ML decisions</a> by <a href="https://juliasilge.com/">Julia Silge</a></h2>
<p>Whereas most of the other talks I’ve shared thus far are broadly inpsirational and entertaining, Julia’s talk is something I could bring directly back to my everyday work. Julia’s talk approaches a question that many new data science learners have but is hard to answer - When performing cross validation, how many folds is too many? And while Julia devotes a good amount of time approaching that question, what her talk really illustrates is how do you break down a question and empirically approach a solution via simulation.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>…unless you cop out with an answer like “it depends” 🙄</p>
</div></div><p>Simulation is such a powerful tool that goes beyond just the introduction of resampling and bootstraps. Simulation is a paradigm that empowers you to structure your belief of how a system works explicitly as a model, and validate those assumptions with real data. I have found so many areas of my work where approaching the thorny problem through the <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/some2/">lens of simulation</a> has clarified my understanding of viable solutions.</p>
<p>If you have only time for 1 talk, this would be my recommendation.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-do-invisible-work-by-chris-albon" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-do-invisible-work-by-chris-albon"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM">Don’t do invisible work</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon">Chris Albon</a></h2>
<p>This is slightly nostalgic for me as Chris’s <a href="https://chrisalbon.com/">data science notes</a> was 1 of the first data science focused resource I chanced upon when first entering the field, and it felt really great to hear Chris’s talk. Chris’s talk focuses on the importance of not doing invisible work and sharing various tips on how you can systematically log the important milestones you achieved and impact for the business you have created.</p>
<p>While there is a clear connection between this talk and your career as a data scientist, I like to think that this practice of putting your work out there also has benefits from a learning angle. Reflecting on the short time I have committed to sharing articles on this blog, I can clearly see the improvement in my clarity of writing and ability to articulate ideas. Beyond the benefits to your career, ensuring you are not doing invisible work is also a very important step to <strong>take charge of your own learning</strong>.</p>

</section>
<section id="lightning-talks" class="level1">
<h1>Lightning Talks</h1>
<section id="hell-is-other-peoples-bugs-by-tj-murphy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hell-is-other-peoples-bugs-by-tj-murphy"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymQT_03-H4">Hell is other people’s bugs</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/teej_m">TJ Murphy</a></h2>
<p>TJ’s lightning talk covers all the common bugs he has seen in experimental platforms. The blind spot here is that while the statistical theory of which ever method you choose might be infallible, the implementation of said method in live experiments is not. As this is precisely the niche area of data science I work in, this talk was pretty much an instant-share for me.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-name-files-by-jenny-bryan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-name-files-by-jenny-bryan"><a href="https://youtu.be/ES1LTlnpLMk">How to name files</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan">Jenny Bryan</a></h2>
<p>If there was ever 1 topic that anyone, and yes, I mean anyone who works in tech has an opinion on, it’s about the right way of naming files. Jenny’s talk covers her recommendations (I agree with them … mostly). This talk is the one that best fits the “normcore” spirit of the entire conference, you <strong>have</strong> to watch it.</p>

<h1>December is upon us 🎄🎅🏻🎄</h1>
<section id="the-advent-of-code" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-advent-of-code">The Advent of Code</h2>
<p>Every December, I get excited about a project called the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code (AOC)</a>. Advent of code is a free-to-join daily coding puzzle project that starts on 1 Dec and concludes on the 25th. Each day a two-part question is released on the site to test your problem-solving skills. Many programmers all around the world enjoy solving these puzzles together in a variety of programming languages. This year, being my <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/2022scala">Year of Scala</a>, it should come as no surprise that I plan on using Scala as my language of choice!</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Amongst the many different programming languages used for AOC, I am always impressed by the mavericks who choose to use <a href="https://detrang1301.github.io/adventofcode-2021-excel/">Excel</a> 🤯</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scala-centers-solutions-for-2021">Scala Center’s Solutions for 2021</h2>
<p>An amazing resource we have to prepare for this year’s AOC are the examples and solutions provided by Scala Center for last year’s AOC - <a href="https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/">Scala Center Solutions to 2021 Advent of Code</a>. Here you can find a variety of solutions using solely Scala’s standard library and showcasing how to best use idiomatic Scala to solve common problems. In this post, I am going to share is a summary of my tips and takeaways.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="scala-cli-more-time-coding-less-time-fiddling" class="level1">
<h1>1. Scala-cli: More time coding, less time fiddling</h1>
<p>Among the many build tools available for Scala projects, my recommendation is <a href="https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/">scala-cli</a>. Scala-cli is by far, the simplest tool that allows you to start solving the actual puzzles you will encounter and minimizes the time you fiddle with your project setup. You will find an easy-to-follow project structure here: https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-advent-of-code. You can install scala-cli via brew (see instructions on their website) or I typically rely on the default <a href="https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation">Coursier</a> setup whose default bundle of packages includes scala-cli.</p>
</section>
<section id="case-class---the-swiss-army-knife-of-modelling-a-problem" class="level1">
<h1>2. Case class - The swiss army knife of modelling a problem</h1>
<p>How are AOC puzzles different from Leetcode? A: AOC puzzles are A LOT more verbose. Puzzles are usually described in a cute story incorporating a lot of storytelling elements which gives AOC its distinct Christmas-y flavour. But, this also means there’s just so much information to parse. One of my favourite features of Scala is the <code>case class</code> because it lends itself so well to converting the information from the question into clear and concise code.</p>

<section id="be-explicit-when-using-mutability" class="level1">
<h1>3. Be explicit when using Mutability</h1>
<p>Scala has a strong sense of pragmatism. Scala encourages immutability as a default, which makes sense as it reduces a lot of unexpected side effects. But, Scala also does not force immutability on you in every circumstance. To use a mutable data structure, you can import like so.</p>

<p>Keeping track of a map of (x,y) coordinates that correspond to a value that can change as the problem progresses is a rather common problem you will encounter. While I am sure you can still solve this problem using immutable data structures, I am glad that an option to use mutability exists. I also enjoy explicitly declaring which data structures are mutable because it reminds me to keep mutability to a minimum.</p>

<h1>4. Use Recursion in place of repetition</h1>
<p>In Scala, the recommendation is to use recursion in places where we need repetition. However, refactoring while loops to a recursive function used to be unintuitive for me, until I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheAtomicmoose"><span class="citation" data-cites="Kit">@Kit</span> Langton</a>’s video.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8rwsxn1iTM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
<p>Once you get a hang of recursion, a lot of solutions that require you to repeat actions while waiting for a condition get a lot simpler to understand. A classic example is a search algorithm which comes up fairly often in AOC.</p>

<h1>5. Pattern matching - Exhaustively check for all paths your code can take</h1>
<p>Pattern matching in Scala is incredibly expressive and I can’t do justice to this amazing feature in a single paragraph. If you are new to Scala, be sure to learn the various ways you can pattern match from the <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html">Scala official website</a>. Specific to the puzzles in AOC, 1 thing I love about pattern matching is that the compiler will exhaustively check for every path my code execution can take and alert me if I missed something (which happens rather often). <img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/aocScala/diagnostic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Compiler checking for exhaustiveness"></p>

<h1>6. Use Try for elegant error handling</h1>
<p>If you have many actions to run and some of which might throw an error, you can handle this situation elegantly by wrapping the actions in a <code>Try</code>. This converts the output to either a <code>Success</code> or <code>Failure</code> type that you can simply filter on.</p>

<p>This is a piece of digital art I created. It features bright colours, straight lines and some fun interactivity.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Try clicking the “Boogie!” button</p>
</div></div><p>You probably realize that my simple artwork is very similar to Piet Mondrian’s iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Boogie_Woogie">Broadway Boogie Woogie</a>. Broadway Boogie Woogie is considered one of Mondrian’s most emblematic paintings and whose aesthetic is instantly recognised all around the world. The original piece is housed today in New York’s <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78682">Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, my amateur recreation is inspired by the original Mondrian, but not directly. In fact, it’s probably more accurate to say, my art piece is a derivative of a derivative.</p>

<h1>Tom Sachs</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsachs.com/exhibitions">Tom Sachs</a> is another influential artist born of a later generation. Tom Sachs had a very special path to the world of art, working in many blue-collar jobs such as lift repairman, electrician, plumber and construction worker. As a result, he has a very special view of the relationship between working with physical materials and the art he creates. Like many, Tom Sachs was very enamoured with Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie Woogie. He liked the art piece so much, he created his own.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Tom Sachs is also credited by both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Caseyneistatofficial">Casey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vanneistat">Van Neistat</a> of Youtube fame as being a key inspiration for their growth as an artist.</p>

<h1>A Genuine Fake</h1>
<p>Tom Sachs explains his thought process here in this <a href="https://youtu.be/cxLxwbm7FMA?t=2490">interview with Adam Savage</a> and in his <a href="https://youtu.be/V8aeaX6Kozw?t=282">Ted Talk</a>. Here are a few choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I know I spent more time and enjoyed Broadway Boogie Woogie than the person who bought it. I know I enjoyed it more because I … built one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Creating my Broadway Boogie Woogie with plywood and gaffers tape, materials that I have a connection with … I am creating authenticity that meets my own standards of what’s important… It’s a Genuine Fake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the most fascinating part of the equation for me. The original art piece is beautiful but in the process of recreating the same art piece using tools that were unique to Tom Sachs, he created his Genuine Fake. It’s a <code>Fake</code> in the sense that it is not the original, but it is also <code>Genuine</code> because Tom Sachs experienced the joy of creating something unique through intense study of the original.</p>
<p>I built my Genuine Fake in hopes that I can experience the same journey. And while I am severely unfamiliar with both oil paint which was used in Mondrian’s original work and plywood used in Tom Sach’s work, I am rather familiar with digital tools and materials, so that is what I decided to use.</p>
<p>Currently, I am taking a course on <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6242-data-visual-analytics">Data and Visual Analytics</a>, which has a strong focus on <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, a javascript visualisation framework, so that is what I used to build <strong>my genuine fake</strong>.</p>

<h1>Interesting things I learnt along the way</h1>
<p>Ok, that’s enough rambling about <strong>Why</strong> I started this project, let me shift gears to list some of my learnings as I worked on <strong>How</strong> to execute this project.</p>
<section id="the-interplay-between-observablejs-d3-quarto" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-interplay-between-observablejs-d3-quarto">The Interplay between ObservableJS / D3 / Quarto</h3>
<p>Quarto, the publishing framework <a href="http://localhost:7537/posts/blogtips/">I keep raving about</a>, supports <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript">ObservableJS</a> right out of the box. ObservableJS is built by the same minds behind D3, so naturally, ObservableJS has D3 libraries preloaded.</p>
<p>To write some D3/ObservableJS code in Quarto, you simply have to create a code block like so</p>
<pre><code>```{ojs}
// This creates an SVG element.
svgRaw = htl.svg`&lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;`

// d3 code goes here
d3.select(svgRaw)
    .attr("width",500)
    .attr("height",500)
    ...
```</code></pre>
<p>Above, you can also see some of the niceties ObservableJS brings, such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/htl">Hypertext Literals</a> which makes it a breeze to create HTML elements directly in the <code>{ojs}</code> code block without the need to touch the raw HTML file.</p>
</section>
<section id="easy-art-with-random-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="easy-art-with-random-data">Easy art with random data</h3>
<p>What makes the entire field of <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/g/generative-art">Generative Art</a> remarkable is how random data is transformed into art pieces. I started out my project seeking to do a pure 1-for-1 copy of the original Mondrian, so every street and block would be in the same position and of the same colour. I soon became really bored of creating a 1-for-1 copy and realized I could make a much more interesting project, simply by randomizing the data that would generate the streets and colours. It was so fun, I decided to include a button (“Boogie!”) so the user could cycle through many variants!</p>
<p>In my implementation, I relied on Javascript’s <code>Math.random()</code> random number generator, which I later learnt is pseudo uniform. D3 includes a more fleshed-out <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-random">d3-random</a> module which exposes more functions from a greater variety of distributions. If I revisit this project again in the future, I would use the d3-random over <code>Math.random()</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d3s-select-enter-update-pattern">D3’s Select-Enter-Update pattern</h3>
<p>D3 has a really difficult to grok <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/general-update-pattern">select-enter-update pattern</a>. The goal here is that once you bind your data to the visual elements of your page, following this pattern allows fine-grain control of how new items are added, existing items are updated and redundant items are removed.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly powerful but this was the hardest part of the D3 syntax for me to understand. It does not help that D3 has several versions and I feel the syntax of this pattern goes through pretty major changes in each version.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transitions-and-animations-really-make-things-pop">Transitions and Animations really make things pop!</h3>
<p>My favourite part of the project was making things animate and move. It’s pretty addictive once I got it working. It is a reminder that building web-based visualisations, while difficult and finicky, can absolutely create interactive and delightful experiences for the end user. When done right, web visualisations are magic.</p>

<p>Art is not my forte, nor my day job but I enjoyed the challenge of creating my Genuine Fake. Through this process, I have a newfound appreciation for the difficulty and satisfaction that comes from building web visualisations.</p>

  <title>How to add some personality to your Quarto Blog</title>
  <dc:creator>Daniel Tan</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="start-from-the-basics" class="level1">
<h1>Start from the basics</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">basic Quarto blog</a> covers a lot of ground. Here is a detailed walkthrough of how to build a blog with Quarto conducted by Rstudio/Posit, the makers of Quarto. Just following this alone will get you started with a perfectly beautiful and functional blog. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVcvXfRyfE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, your blog is also your personal slice out on the internet, and if you can add just a tad bit of your personality into the content, it makes it more enjoyable for your readers. Here are my favourite tips.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Note
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>While it is fun to add these bells and whistles, do not lose focus on the most important part of your blog - the content.</p>
</div>
</div>

<section id="enrich-your-appendices" class="level1">
<h1>1. Enrich your Appendices</h1>
<p>An important facet that Quarto supports is <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html">Scholarly Writing</a>. With a few simple flags in your <a href="https://github.com/ddanieltan/ddanieltan.com/blob/main/posts/_metadata.yml">_metadata.yml</a> file, you can easily configure each blog post to neatly organize your footnotes, references, license and citation information in an appendix section at the bottom of your post.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/appendices.html">appendix section</a> is easily customizable by inserting any other information you think your reader might appreciate. 1 of the simplest things to add is a <code>Last Updated</code> section. I insert this block of code at the bottom of every post, and each time I make a change to a post and re-render, this code chunk will automatically reflect this last updated date.</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="1">
<details open="">

<section id="make-custom-css-tweaks" class="level1">
<h1>2. Make custom CSS tweaks</h1>
<p>The default Quarto blog comes ready with many Bootstrap themes from the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch project</a>. I found that a really efficient way to tackle styling for your blog is to start with one of these ready-made themes (I chose Litera) and then add on custom css to make small tweaks. I am consistently surprised how some seemingly small css tweaks can create a dramatic effect on your overall site.</p>
<p>I wrote this <a href="https://github.com/ddanieltan/ddanieltan.com/blob/main/custom.scss">SCSS snippet</a> following steps from <a href="https://youtu.be/ErRX8plZpQE">RappA’s youtube video</a>. This block of css helps to perfectly align the elements in my navbar with the margins of my content body. I cannot express in words how much joy this tiny tweak brings me.</p>

<h1>3. Sneak in Easter Eggs in your page footer</h1>
<p>Page footers are generally reserved for important business-y messages. The usual suspects are either copyrights, licenses or “lovingly built with”s. I wanted my blog to be slightly different. I like to reward any reader who has read my posts all the way to the end with a nice easter egg in the form of one of my favourite quotes!</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Scroll down right now and find your easter-egg quote! Thank you for reading my post in its entirety 😊</p>

<p>When I first wrote this post, I used Quarto’s <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render">pre and post render hooks</a> to insert a new quote into the <code>page-footer</code> field of my <code>_quarto.yml</code>. But this proved clunky, because <code>_quarto.yml</code> was a project-wide config, and I wanted a different quote for every post, which meant I needed to manually trigger this pre-render hook multiple times. As of <a href="https://github.com/ddanieltan/ddanieltan.com/commit/98c069f1f97fa198fcaa065c87259abae45b72a0">this commit</a>, I opted to add my random quotes using code blocks instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I maintain a simple text file with quotes that I enjoy. I simply pick a random quote from this file, wrap the text and insert the output into <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags like so.</p>

<h1>My Year of …</h1>
<p>Neil Gaiman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman_bibliography">illustrious author</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/jarrylee/neil-gaiman-wins-twitter">everlasting source of wit</a>, has a really cool mental exercise to help him complete his projects.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You don’t have to write. You have permission to not write, but you don’t have permission to do anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I would go down to my lovely little gazebo at the bottom of the garden, sit down, and I’m absolutely allowed not to do anything. I’m allowed to sit at my desk, I’m allowed to stare out at the world, I’m allowed to do anything I like, as long as it isn’t anything. Not allowed to do a crossword, not allowed to read a book, not allowed to phone a friend, not allowed to make a clay model of something. All I’m allowed to do is absolutely nothing, or write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a couple of years now, I have adapted a version of this exercise to help me complete my learning projects. Every year I make the grand announcement that this will be the year of X. Where X is a learning topic or a new programming language that I wish to focus on.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">

</div>
<p>Inspired by Neil’s rules, my rules for this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every project that requires coding, I am going to try and use Scala</li>
<li>But, I give myself permission to not use Scala if it is just not the right option for my use case</li>
<li>However, I do not have permission to try out any other shiny new programming language I might be tempted by</li>

<h1>What is Scala?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a programming language that is probably most famous for consistently showing up as one of the “Top Paying Technologies” in <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey">StackOverflow’s annual survey</a> 🤑🤑🤑. In Data Science, Scala is famous for being the language used to build the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> engine, which makes Scala essentially the core language that “Enterprise Big Data<sup>TM</sup>” is run on.</p>

<p>My 1-liner description of Scala (with the caveat that I am pretty much still a beginner) is that Scala feels like <strong>a language designed for modelling and manipulating data</strong>.</p>
<p>I enjoy Scala’s</p>
<ul>
<li>legible and easy-to-read syntax</li>
<li>encouraged design pattern of running an immutable data source through chains of transformations (which should be familiar to fans of <a href="https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining.html">Python’s method chaining</a> or <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html">R’s pipe</a>)</li>
<li>ability to give me a <a href="https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/FromFirstPrinciplesWhyScala.html">dynamic language experience with the safety of a compiled language</a></li>
<li>power/scalability out-of-the-box thanks to piggy-backing on the highly optimized JVM</li>
<li>unique features such as <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html">Case Classes</a>, <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html">Implicits</a> etc. that gives the language that extra bit of black magic to set it apart</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why Scala?</h1>
<p>The main reason is that I recently joined a team where our main codebase is in Scala. This gives me a practical incentive, as well as, the opportunity to be surrounded by knowledgable colleagues who I can pester with my questions.</p>
<p>The secondary reason is curiosity. Scala is designed to support both the object-oriented paradigm and the functional programming paradigm. Through Scala, I hope to dip my toes into the great ocean that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional Programming</a>.</p>

<p>Pretty good! I have not burnt out and I have found opportunities to use Scala in my projects for work, school and play. So far I have used Scala to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Write applications to improve my tooling for work</p></li>
<li><p>Build random number generators for a module for school</p></li>
<li><p>Create a rudimentary (and incomplete) <a href="https://github.com/ddanieltan/scalaBlog">blog engine</a></p></li>
<li><p>Inch my way through the excellent <a href="https://www.handsonscala.com/">Hands-on Scala</a> book</p></li>
<li><p>Automate small scripting tasks (although I’m still not convinced Scala is my 1st choice as a scripting language)</p></li>
<li><p>Build a simple website without writing 1 line of javascript (😲!!) thanks to <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I have also found small ways to engage with the small but fascinating community. For example, I enjoyed learning a little history behind Scala by asking the Reddit community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/smq3t2/whats_the_story_behind_scalas_logo/">What’s the story behind Scala’s logo?</a>.</p>

<h1>An organisational nightmare</h1>
<p>I have one machine for work, one machine for personal stuff and a bunch of servers for projects and school work. As I hop in and out of these separate computing systems, it gets pretty difficult to synchronise all my config files, settings, scripts and shortcuts.</p>

<p>1As this is a common problem that plagues many programmers, it is unsurprising that there is a clever piece of software written to solve this problem - <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">Stow</a>. Stow is a symlink manager that when coupled with any version control software (ie. git) can create a simple and effective config sync system. I have used such a system for the last couple of months and is something I can no longer live without.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I find myself bringing up Stow pretty often in conversations so I wanted to take <span class="citation" data-cites="drob">@drob</span>’s advice. However, as there are <a href="https://dr563105.github.io/blog/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/">many</a> <a href="https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/">excellent</a> <a href="https://venthur.de/2021-12-19-managing-dotfiles-with-stow.html">blogs</a> that already do a great job explaining what Stow is, I think I can’t add much value to that conversation. Instead, I’m going to shift my energy toward creating a straightforward how-to recipe.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-big-picture" class="level1">
<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
<p>Here is the big picture of how a Stow-enabled config synchronisation system is set up.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You will need a <code>dotfiles</code> version-controlled repository. The simplest approach here would be to create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">Github repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>In <code>dotfiles</code>, you will create separate folders for each application’s config file you wish to keep in sync. What you name these folders is totally up to you, but conventionally most people name the folder after the application</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a simple <code>dotfiles</code> repo might look like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">├──</span> aliases</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">├──</span> kitty</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">└──</span> nvim</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, I intend to sync my shell aliases, terminal configs (<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>) and editor configs (<a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>), so I create a separate folder for each.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Within each folder, you can create the config files that we want to be kept in-sync</p></li>
<li><p>Using Stow, you can then create a symlink of these config files which would be placed in the right locations on your file system for the respective applications to read from</p></li>
<li><p>Once this is set up, the day-to-day usage of this system is incredibly simple. Any time you make make edits to your config files on 1 machine, you simply need to commit and push the changes made in your <code>dotfiles</code> repo. Your config files are symlink-ed to the files in your <code>dotfiles</code> repo, and any edit you make will be updated. Next time you hop into a different machine, just pull down the latest changes in the <code>dotfiles</code> repo and all your configs will be updated</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 3 and 4 are the tricky bits and I provide a more detailed example of them below.</p>
</section>
<section id="syncing-a-config-file-for-the-1st-time" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Syncing a config file for the 1st time</h1>
<p>Here is an example scenario. I have 2 machines (A and B), and I want to sync the configurations for the terminal application, e.g.&nbsp;the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> terminal. To configure this terminal, you would edit a config file <code>kitty.conf</code> whose default location is <code>~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf</code>. Here is what you would do:</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Yes, I see the irony in using Kitty because it is a GPU-accelerated application whose primary function is to print out text…</p>
</div></div><ol type="1">
<li><p>We start from machine A. Firstly, you will need to delete the existing <code>kitty.conf</code> file</p></li>
<li><p>In your <code>dotfiles</code> repo, within the <code>kitty</code> folder, create a new <code>kitty.conf</code> file but make sure this file is in the same folder structure of the default config location. I.e. your new config file should sit in the <code>dotfiles</code> repo like this</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">├──</span> aliases</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">├──</span> kitty</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">│</span>   └── .config</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">│</span>       └── kitty</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">│</span>           └── kitty.conf</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">└──</span> nvim</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Fill up <code>kitty.conf</code> with your desired settings</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate back up to the <code>dotfiles</code> repo and run <code>stow kitty</code>. This command will create a symlink of the contents of the kitty folder, which will create a <code>kitty.conf</code> in the <code>~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf</code> location</p></li>
<li><p>We are done setting up on Machine A. Commit and push the changes to your <code>dotfiles</code> repo</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, log into Machine B. Pull down the changes and because we have not run stow in this machine, you will need to run <code>stow kitty</code> here too to create the symlinks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stow is something you only need to run the 1st time you add a config file. You do not have to run <code>stow</code> for any subsequent edits.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations" class="level1">
<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>This config sync system is pretty sweet but it is not without some limitations. Here is a couple for you to be aware of.</p>
<p>Stowing too many config files can also get out of hand pretty quickly. You probably want to consider which applications you are genuinely using often enough across multiple machines, just so you avoid creating obsolete symlinks.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some situations where you do not want config files synced. For example, I do not use this system to sync my shell configs because my shell configs might contain sensitive environment variables or have settings unique to the type of hardware the software is running on.</p>

<p>You get the gist. From models using a single distribution to ones using complex combinations of distributions, our ability to generate random variates allows us to simulate almost any scenario we can think of!</p>
</section>
<section id="how-random-variates-are-generated" class="level1">
<h1>How random variates are generated</h1>
<p>But, how do computers even produce these random variates? Surely, there can’t be a specialised function for every one of the infinite distributions out in the world. It turns out that computers have a very simple solution in the form of two ingredients - a pseudorandom uniform generator and the inverse transform theorem.</p>
<p>A pseudoranom uniform generator is an algorithm that produces random variates from a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Unif~(0,1)"> distribution, producing uniformly random numbers between 0 and 1. There are many different algorithms that can produce uniform random variates and they are judged on how well they can come close to a perfectly random generator. The assortment of different uniform generators each with their pros and cons are interesting, but that will not be the focus of today’s post. Today, I want to focus on the 2nd ingredient, the inverse transform theorem.</p>

<section id="inverse-transform-theorem" class="level1">
<h1>Inverse Transform Theorem</h1>
<p>The Inverse Transform Theorem is the backbone behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse Transform Sampling</a>, and is how a uniform distribution is transformed to a diverse range of other distributions.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge when I first encountered this theorem was to grasp the key idea behind its simplicity. Here is the theorem:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> be a continuous random variable with c.d.f <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(x)">. Then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(X)%20%5Csim%20Unif(0,1)">.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, here’s the equally perplexing simple proof:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%20=%20F(X)"> and suppose that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> has a c.d.f <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G(y)">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G(y)%20=%20P(Y%20%5Cleq%20y)%20=%20P(F(Y)%20%5Cleq%20y)%20"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20=%20P(X%20%5Cleq%20F%5E%7B-1%7D(y))%20=%20F(F%5E%7B-1%7D(y))%20=%20y"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me explain the mechanics of the theorem. This theorem simply states that given we have a cumulative density function of a continuous random variable, the inverse of the CDF function will produce a Uniform distribution. While the usage of the theorem reads like a straight forward recipe, I had so many questions about why the theorem works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the theorem and proof so simple?</li>
<li>How could this theorem be universally true for any distribution?</li>
<li>Why did the theorem introduce the cumulative density function seemingly out of nowhere?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Visual connection</h1>
<p>And what I see as a recurring theme amongst SoME submissions, is that for many mathematical concepts that appear hard to understand in written form, we can achieve some clarity by expressing the ideas in visual form. Here is my go at it.</p>
<p>Here are a number of cumulative density functions for an assortment of distributions.</p>

<p>Despite coming in every imaginable shape and size, CDFs for any function have 1 similarity. Their output (y-axis) will always be bound between 0 and 1. This makes a lot of sense when we consider that the CDF is characterised for being a <em>monotonic increasing</em> function. The CDF graphs the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X%3Cx)">, given that the output is a probability, the Y axis will always be bounded between 0 and 1. This property is very useful when we match it back to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Unif(0,1)"> distribution. A uniform distribution produces random variates similarly bound between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is to understand that just as a function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F(x)"> can be visually described as a transformation mapping values from the X axis to values on the Y axis, and the inverse of that said function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%5E%7B-1%7D(x)"> is simply the inverse transformation mapping values from the Y axis to the X axis.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So putting all the pieces together, this is how the Inverse Transform Theorem is put into action:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Unif(0,1)"> distribution produces a random uniform between 0 and 1</p></li>
<li><p>This is akin to picking a random point on the Y axis of a CDF for your distribution of interest</p></li>
<li><p>The inverse function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%5E%7B-1%7D(x)"> maps the random uniform on the Y axis to a value on the X axis</p></li>
<li><p>And this X axis value in turn becomes a random variate from your distribution of interest</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Inverse Transform Theorem is a remarkable piece of math that links the uniform distribution to just about any other distribution we could think of. It’s a crucial piece in the machinery of modern machines that enable us to run simulations, and I hope this post helps to share the visual a-ha intuition I experienced when I was learning about this topic.</p>

<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p>I started this blog to have a place on the internet where I can practice and publish my writing. Writing has been a very remarkable tool for both my professional and personal life. It helps me to organise my thoughts, maximise my impact and reflect on my learnings. Yet, I have consistently not prioritised writing and it is a disservice to myself that I have not made set aside time for deliberate practice.</p>
<p>I have started and abandoned more blogs than I can remember, so I always start a new blogging project with some apprehension. But, as mentioned above, writing is too important for me to not try again.</p>
<p>Here’s to another shot at this. Wish me luck!</p>

<h1>Quarto</h1>
<p>One reason why I got tempted to start a blog again is <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>! Quarto is the shiny, new publishing framework (from <del>RStudio</del><a href="https://posit.co/">Posit</a>) that I use to publish this blog. Quarto is reminiscent of Rmarkdown, but rebuilt around the pandoc engine. Quarto feels purpose built for the entire data community, supporting all the major Data Science languages (Python, R, Julia, Javascript), and supporting a wide spectrum of output formats (pdf reports, websites, presentations and more).</p>
<p>You can see my unbridled enthusiasm after first learning about Quarto here.</p>
