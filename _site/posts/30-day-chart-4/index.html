<p>Today’s theme is Waffle and I would like to create a <a href="https://datavizproject.com/data-type/percentage-grid/">waffle chart</a>. Waffle charts are excellent for displaying and comparing proportions or part-to-whole relationships within a dataset. They are particularly useful when you want to show how a whole is divided among different categories or segments.</p>
<p>However, my visualisation library of choice <a href="https://lets-plot.org/python/index.html">lets-plot</a> does not have a pre-made “geom” or layer specifically for waffle charts. This means that I have got to get a bit more hands-on to make one today. My plan is to piece it together myself using lets-plot’s building block shapes and layers.</p>
<section id="singapore-population-census-data" class="level1">
<h1>Singapore Population Census Data</h1>
<p>For today’s dataset, I opted to use Singapore’s population census data from 2000 to 2020 (<a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/reference/cop2020/cop2020-sr1/census20_stat_release1">Source</a>).</p>
<p>This dataset tracks our population growth of Singapore residents (split either as Singapore citizens or Permanent residents) and our non residents. I believe a waffle chart is a good visualisation for this type of data to show both the growth of the overall population, as well as, its component groups.</p>
<p>To condense the population information, I decided that every square on my waffle chart would represent about 50,000 population.</p>

<h1>Creating a Waffle</h1>
<p>The main way I will create my waffle chart is by manipulating the <code>geom_tile</code> layer. This allows me to draw equally spaced rectangular squares. This stage took the longest time as I experimented with many combinations of width, height and colours to implement what I envisioned. With more than 1 waffle to draw, I created a helper function.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I ran into a limitation of <code>gggrid()</code> here. I was unable to insert a title, caption or legend on my final composition of multiple charts. This was slightly frustrating and I sorely missed the equivalent functionality that is available in R’s ggplot ecosystem e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html">patchwork</a>.</p>

<section id="finishing-up-on-canva" class="level1">
<h1>Finishing up on Canva</h1>
<p>So, I moved my chart over to <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> for few final touches, and here’s the end product!</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Polars has a convenient <code>rows()</code> method that returns rows of selected columns as a List of Tuples. Useful if your collected data fits in memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://lets-plot.org/python/pages/api/lets_plot.geom_tile.html#lets_plot.geom_tile">Let-plot geom_tile</a> works really well with <code>np.linspace</code> to control width and height.</li>
<li>I cannot apply titles, captions or legends on a composition of plots using gggrid(). So in the future, I need to draw those elements on the component graphs instead.</li>
<li>Attempting to build up a visualisation from base parts is a challenging task, but being able to achieve your original vision is a great feeling! 😁</li>
