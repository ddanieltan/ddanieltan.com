    "text": "What is Causal Inference?\nIf you’ve taken a statistics class or worked in the data industry, you’ve probably heard this warning: “Correlation does not imply causation!” While this is definitely true, I’ve always wondered, “Well, what does imply causation?”\n\n\n\nxkcd never gets old\n\n\nWhen we use correlation and other measurements of association in our machine learning models, we end up with a good understanding of dependence. ML models are great at identifying patterns that link our features to outcomes, which is why they can make such accurate predictions. But even with these accurate predictions, we may not always have a clear understanding of the complex cause-and-effect forces at play in the system.\nThat’s where causal inference comes in. It’s the study of these cause-and-effect forces – not just being able to predict future outcomes, but also understanding which factors contribute and how."

    "text": "Why did I choose Causal Inference?\n\nCausal Inference can answer questions classic Experimentation theory cannot\nAt work, I’m often involved in designing online experiments using randomized control trials (also known as A/B tests), which are considered the gold standard for gathering causal inferences. But RCTs aren’t always feasible – sometimes the question we’re trying to answer requires a longer timeline, or it might be unethical to test (like the effects of smoking).\nOutside of the clean data we get from RCTs, there’s a wealth of observational data from field experiments, surveys, and logs that we can use to draw causal inferences. There are so many interesting questions that we can generate looking at these data and causal inference could provide me new tools to my statistical toolkit to answer them.\n\n\nCausal Inference is relatable to everyone\nSecond, causal inference is something that’s relevant to everyone. We all make a ton of decisions every day – from what to have for breakfast to whether we need to take an umbrella with us. A lot of these decisions are influenced by our understanding of the causal forces at play in our lives. I believe that, with the right set of skills, we can “play the hand we’re dealt” as best we can, even if we can’t change the circumstances we were born into.\n\n\nThere is a resurgence of materials to help one learn Causal Inference\nFinally, there’s been a resurgence of materials on causal inference lately, starting with the Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to proponents of the field in 2021. There are more resources available now than ever before to help people learn about causal inference, which makes it a great time to dive in."

    "section": "Plan for the Year",
    "text": "Plan for the Year\nHere is my collection of study materials that I plan on using this year:\n\nStructured Courses\nStructured or semi-structured courses with assignments and projects are my favourite format for learning. I found Coursera’s Essential Causal Inference Techniques for Data Science . This looks to be a straight-forward, short introduction to causal inference techniques to survey the landscape.\n\n\nMaterials that come with a community\nThese are the primary resources I plan to use, particularly because these are all resources that facilitate a community of learners either by providing a study group or video lectures. This is important to me because I enjoy have this community to learn with and learn from.\nScott Cunningham’s Causal Inference Mixtape is the single most recommended material on Causal Inference. You can read the free online copy or support the Prof. Cunningham by purchasing a print copy (links on the home page). Last year, Ravin Kumar organised a Causal Inference Book Club, so there is a lively community of online discussions and youtube videos to study along side with.\nRichard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking is perhaps my favourite textbook of all time. While this material is more often billed as an introduction to Bayesian statistics, I have always found a lot of the central themes align with the pursuit of causality. The printed copy needs to be purchased but Prof. McElreath provides free recordings of his lectures on youtube. 2023’s lectures just began this month.\n\n\nWhat do you mean it’s not a thing to have a “favourite textbook”?! Everyone has one, right? Right?\nMatheus Facure’s Causal Inference for the Brave and True is another material that is on the top of many recommendations. The above 2 recommendations primarily have their code examples in R, so Matheus’s alternative with Python examples fits a nice gap. Matheus is also working on an O’Reilly book Causal Inference in Python which I am eagerly waiting for.\nNick Huntington-Klien’s The Effect Book rounds up my list of recommended materials. The Effect Book is a comprehensive dive into causal inference paired with research design, and Dr. Huntington-Klien even includes an accompanying free Youtube video series along with homework assignments and source code to learn from. The online version of the book is free and you can purchase the print copy from links on its home page.\n\n\nMaterials for solo studying and referencing\nThis is a shorter list of materials that do not come with a ready online community. These are more traditional academic textbooks that I plan to peruse occasionally when referencing a gnarly topic.\n\nElements of Causal Inference\nField Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation\nIntroductory Econometrics A Modern Approach"

Eventually, being able to complete a larger analysis more akin to the type of problems I hope to address at work. I would like the opportunity to try out several different libraries from a variety of programming languages, if applicable. I bookmarked Emily Riederer’s blog on Causal Design Patterns for Data Analysts for reference, and I hope to be able to implement each of the patterns she describes by the end of the year.\n\n\nLearning about the Causal Inference landscape\nCausal Inference is a broad umbrella comprising of many professionals from a wide swathe of disciplines. Besides learning the technical methodologies, I would like to learn more about the academics, educators and practitioners that make up its global community. Prof. Cunningham also records a podcast interviewing several causal inference experts. It might be a nice break from studying to allocate some time to listen to their stories and write a few summary posts on my blog.\n\n\nBlogging\nWhich brings me to this blog! Last year, I started this blog and published 8 blog articles. I aim to publish 12 this year (mostly about Causal Inference) and share with you the learnings along my journey."

I have used such a system for the last couple of months and is something I can no longer live without.\n\n\nWhen you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a functionWhen you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post\n\n— David Robinson (@drob) November 9, 2017\n\n\nI find myself bringing up Stow pretty often in conversations so I wanted to take @drob’s advice. However, as there are many excellent blogs that already do a great job explaining what Stow is, I think I can’t add much value to that conversation. Instead, I’m going to shift my energy toward creating a straightforward how-to recipe."

In an arena where many other tech conferences focus on the latest and greatest, this conference is a breath of fresh air! I can sincerely share that I found more ideas to bring back to try at my work from this conference than any previous conference I have attended.\n\nThe conference was held in a single day, split between 3 sessions and several lightning talks. Each session had about 10 speakers covering a variety of topics. All of these are available for free on NormConf’s youtube channel.\nI spent the weekend catching up on all the talks and wanted to share a couple of my favourites:"

In fact, to conduct and model experiments for a large-scale business operation (like I do for work), the usage of Spark is pretty much table stakes. That said, like many powerful tools, Spark is also a frustrating footgun.\nGuenia shares her experience on common pitfalls you might encounter when building Spark applications for the 1st time. I found myself nodding silently as she went through every mistake that I personally faced when I first started learning Spark. Additionally, she gives useful tips explaining the implications for each Spark command you invoke which promotes a better understanding of the entire Spark framework.\nIf you are new to Spark, I have to recommend the first couple of minutes of Guenia’s talk as she provides one of the clearest and most succint crash course to Spark I have seen presented."

Describing herself as an “engineering-artist”, Helena shared details and examples of her artwork and art process. I was deeply inspired by the many similarities Helena drew between the process of refining art work with the iterative nature of building complex models.\nI have always enjoyed the rare occasion where I get to play with generative art, and listening to a true artist’s artist share about her process was an incredible treat."

    "text": "How many folds is too many? Efficient simulation for everyday ML decisions by Julia Silge\nWhereas most of the other talks I’ve shared thus far are broadly inpsirational and entertaining, Julia’s talk is something I could bring directly back to my everyday work. Julia’s talk approaches a question that many new data science learners have but is hard to answer - When performing cross validation, how many folds is too many? And while Julia devotes a good amount of time approaching that question, what her talk really illustrates is how do you break down a question and empirically approach a solution via simulation.\n\n\n…unless you cop out with an answer like “it depends” 🙄\nSimulation is such a powerful tool that goes beyond just the introduction of resampling and bootstraps. Simulation is a paradigm that empowers you to structure your belief of how a system works explicitly as a model, and validate those assumptions with real data. I have found so many areas of my work where approaching the thorny problem through the lens of simulation has clarified my understanding of viable solutions.\nIf you have only time for 1 talk, this would be my recommendation."

Chris’s talk focuses on the importance of not doing invisible work and sharing various tips on how you can systematically log the important milestones you achieved and impact for the business you have created.\nWhile there is a clear connection between this talk and your career as a data scientist, I like to think that this practice of putting your work out there also has benefits from a learning angle. Reflecting on the short time I have committed to sharing articles on this blog, I can clearly see the improvement in my clarity of writing and ability to articulate ideas. Beyond the benefits to your career, ensuring you are not doing invisible work is also a very important step to take charge of your own learning."

    "text": "21 January 2021, that’s the date I created in my first note in my Obsidian vault. Back then, it was just an experiment in my ongoing quest to find the perfect note-taking tool. Evernote, Roam Research, and even the good ol’ pen and paper took their turns on my desk. But ever since I started using Obsidian, I never used another tool again. Since that day, Obsidian has been my constant companion through learning adventures, career changes, study sessions, and moments of personal reflection. What started as a simple app transformed into an indispensable tool, the backstage manager of my life, keeping everything in check."

    "text": "1. Obsidian allows structure to grow organically\nMost note-taking tools require you to decide upon the structure of your note before you record the note. For example, say I am taking notes while going through one of deeplearning.ai’s excellent Generative AI LLM courses, before writing down my notes, I might have to decide on my folder structure.\nPerhaps I should structure my notes by their topic\n├── Instruction Fine Tuning\n│   ├── Single Task\n│   └── Multi Task\n├── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\n├── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)\n├── Model Evaluation Metrics\n    └── LLM benchmarks\nOr perhaps I should structure my notes based by date so I can track my learning progress over time\n├── 2024-01-01\n├── 2024-01-02\n│   └── Instruction Fine Tuning\n├── 2024-01-03\n│   └── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\n├── 2024-01-04\n│   └── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)\n└── 2024-01-05\nEither way could be valid, depending on how I plan to revise and reorganise my notes in the future. But having to decide upon a structure upfront before I get the chance to start recording my notes never feels good.\n\nInternal Links\nObsidian offers a powerful feature to solve this problem - Internal Links. Here is an example of Internal Links in action: \nBy wrapping any idea/noun/topic in double [[]] brackets Obsidian creates a dedicated new notes for that item, as well as the connection between the note I am currently taking and the one that was just created. In this short paragraph, I have linked both a date 2024-01-02 and several key topics e.g. (In-context learning), which means that when I want to revisit or reorganise my notes, I can do so either by topic or by date.\n\n\nWith internal links, I enjoy keeping my notes in a flat hierachy but I have seen vaults that still prefer folders. Obsidian supports both preferences equally well 🙂\nThis flexibility enables me to build my vault out with an organic structure that adapts to my learning needs."

    "text": "2. Obsidian helps me link atomic ideas into greater understanding\nKnowledge is a mosaic crafted from interconnected ideas.\n\nWhat my vault started asWhat my vault grew into\n\n\n\nHere is the graph view of my Obsidian vault in my 1st year. Every node in this graph is a single note. It is clear that when I was first starting out, I was writing down disparate, unconnected notes. I was probably writing down a lot of interesting ideas, but I had not taken the time to connect these ideas to gain a broader understanding.\n\n\n\nAs I continued using Obsidian, I started to link notes together. This could be done either when the notew was first created, or when I scheduled time to review these notes again. Soon, I saw clusters of ideas organically forming into broader topics. My deep dive into Scala, my exploration of Causal Inference and a whole variety of subjects that interest me came out of these clusters. And today, I have a nice graphical topology of sorts that represents my learning journey and keeps me motivated."

This simple decision means that Obsidian notes:\n\nCan be used offline\nCan be edited with any text editor\nCan be viewed with a variety of text readers\nCan be easily synced on iCloud, Dropbox or using git\nIs yours, forever!\n\nObsidian’s CEO Steph Ango wrote a dedicated blog post on this philosophy that went deeper into this philosophy. He shared that all software is ephemeral and Obsidian wants to give people ownership over their own data, which is an approach that builds trust for its users.\nEdit: Hackernews discussion thread"

    "text": "Exercism is a website where you can learn how to code in a variety of programming languages. I do enjoy learning new programming languages and this site is one of my favourite places to find both instructional as well as practical content and exercises. When it comes to learning a new programming language, I’ve found that online courses can sometimes provide too much instruction without enough hands-on practice. On the other hand, project-based learning can go too far in the opposite direction, focusing heavily on practical work but lacking structure and guidance.\nExercism strikes a nice balance between the two extremes. It gives you just the right amount of instruction combined with coding exercises to solidify your understanding. It’s like the “Goldilocks” solution – not too much theory, not too little, but just the right mix to make the learning process enjoyable and effective.\nAdditionally, compared to other large names in this space ie. LeetCode, I find Exercism a lot more focused on teaching you how to utilise the features of a programming language more so than how to pass the Algorithms round of coding interviews."

You’ll find a great selection of tracks for both popular languages and some more obscure ones. No matter how familiar I think I am with a language, I always end up learning something new from the exercises. And it’s been really cool to get exposed to languages I’d never even heard of before. The variety ensures there’s something engaging for everyone to explore.\n\nFind an exercise from a Track\nCopy the exercism cli command to download the problem. E.g. exercism download --track=python --exercise=chaitanas-colossal-coaster\nNavigate to your configured workspace directory and start solving!

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve picked up a clever new technique or a more idiomatic way of writing code just by exploring the top-rated solutions from others.\nBut in my opinion, the killer feature of Exercism is the ability to request a code review from an actual human mentor - not a bot. Code reviews are a huge part of real software development jobs, so it’s fantastic that this platform exposes you to that process in a supportive, low-stress environment. Getting that experience early on is invaluable!\nHope you found this short write up useful and you give Exercism a try!"

Every day for the month of April 2024 has a key word prompt (see image above). For each prompt, participants all around the world come up with an original data visualisation to share.\nOn a whim, I decided to participate in this challenge as I think it’s a great way try something new, better understand my tools and engage with a vibrant community.\nGiven that this is very much a last-minute decision, I’ll choose to use Python libraries that I am familiar with. polars has already completely replaced pandas for my data manipulation needs and lets-plot is one of my favourite ggplot2 ports in Python.\n\n\nCode\nimport polars as pl\nfrom lets_plot import *\nLetsPlot.setup_html()\n\n\n\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\nData Prep\nI have heard rumours of Chick-Fil-A looking to open it’s 1st outlet in Singapore (source), so I was inspired to make a visualisation to show the component parts of the major macro-nutrients - Protein, Carbohydrates and Fat for its popular menu items.
